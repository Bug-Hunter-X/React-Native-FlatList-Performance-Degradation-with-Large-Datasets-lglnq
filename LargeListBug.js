This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance becomes sluggish, and scrolling is jerky. This is especially noticeable on lower-end devices. The issue stems from the fact that `FlatList` by default renders every item in the dataset.  For very large datasets, this becomes inefficient.  The problem manifests as slow scrolling, dropped frames, and eventually, the app may become unresponsive.
